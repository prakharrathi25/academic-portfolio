        * Worked with the highest ranked research institute in France on a problem of suicide analysis in Lille.
        * Used the socio-economic data collected from people who attempted suicide to predict whether they would attempt it again. It was also used to identify the factors which contribute to first time and repeated attempts.
        * Implemented the concepts of semi-parametric regression, statistical modelling and spatial econometrics using R.   
        * Our work determined the probability of suicide attempts in the next 6 months with an AUC Score of 0.89. This work will be submitted to the local government in Lille and a paper will also be written.

      * I conducted various test to ascertain the results which included downside risk measures like Value at Risk, CVaR, Semideviation, Sharpe and Sortino Ratios. I also developed pipelines which automated the process of investing and testing on past data using Python.

      * Developed and deployed a machine learning tool for the Union Bank of India which allotted risk scores to customers based on past customer data. The bank used the model to decide which customers would receive a loan. My risk allocation model brought down the customer default rate by 11% on 2 years of testing data.
